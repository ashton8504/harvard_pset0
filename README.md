## Introduction
In this section of the Harvard CS50 Python course, we delved into the world of functions. Functions are powerful tools that allow us to break our code into smaller, reusable, and organized blocks. They help simplify complex tasks and improve code readability.

## Concepts Covered
During this section, we covered the following key concepts:

1. **Function Definition**: We learned how to define functions in Python using the `def` keyword.

2. **Function Arguments**: Understanding how to pass arguments to functions, allowing us to provide input for our computations.

3. **Return Statements**: We explored the usage of the `return` statement to output values from functions.

4. **Scope and Local Variables**: Understanding the scope of variables inside and outside functions.

5. **Default Parameters**: Defining default values for function parameters, making certain arguments optional.

6. **Function Composition**: Building more complex functions by combining smaller functions.
